We plan to make a mobile app that uses a predicting model to give notification about imminent earthquakes around the user's location. The app when granted location access, will display relevant data like magnitude of earthquake on Richter Scale, its epicenter ,nearby locations which are prone to the disaster and will predict time range of the next occurence. It will also display all earthquake related info of major disaster prone areas. 
 
The model we plan to employ will make use of data obtained from National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) determines the location and size of all significant earthquakes that occur worldwide and disseminates this information immediately to national and international agencies, scientists, critical facilities, and the general public. 

We also plan to add a feature in the app through which users will ber able to provide monetary donation to NGOs across the world which work for disaster management, relief and rehabilitation.
